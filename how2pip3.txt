pip3 is used to install python packages.
A python virtual environment can be used to keep project-related python packages in one place
The python3-venv package can be used to manage this virtual environment
1: install the python3 module
    sudo apt install python3-venv
2: navigate to the project directory
    cd <somewhere>/mod-5/
3: create the virtual env in a folder called virtualenv by running the following
    python3 -m venv virtualenv
        Note: this will create a new folder calles virtualenv that will be ignored by git because of the .gitignore file.
4: activate the virtual env
    source ./virtualenv/bin/activate
        You should now see (virtualenv) in your console
5: upgrade pip3
    pip3 install --upgrade pip
6: download project requirements from the requirements file
    pip3 install -r pip3requirments.txt


Installing new project requirements can be done with
    pip3 install -r pip3requirements.txt


To DISABLE the virtual environment:
1. just type
    deactivate



To ADD a project requirement:
1. install needed package
    pip3 install <package>
2. check requirements file
    pip3 freeze
3. to overwrite the project requirements file 
    pip3 freeze > pip3requirements.txt
