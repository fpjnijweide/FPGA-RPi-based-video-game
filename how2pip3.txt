pip3 is used to install python packages.
A python virtual environment can be used to keep project-related python packages in one place
The python3-venv package can be used to manage this virtual environment
1: install the python3 module
    sudo apt install python3-venv
2: navigate to the project directory
    cd <somewhere>/mod-5/
3: create the virtual env in a folder called virtualenv by running the following
    python3 -m venv virtualenv
4: activate the virtual env
    source ./virtualenv/bin/activate
        You should now see (virtualenv) in your console
5: upgrade pip3
    pip3 install --upgrade pip
6: download project requirements from the requirements file
    pip3 install -r pip3requirments.txt
