This stuff is all not necessary for now and can be ignored
In the future however, it could be useful to use a virtualenv for easy dependency installing.
This is because we will need to provide exact instructions on how to get our program up and running for the final files we hand in.

pip3 is used to install python packages.
A python virtual environment can be used to keep project-related python packages in one place
The python3-venv package can be used to manage this virtual environment
1: install the python3 module
    sudo apt install python3-venv
2: navigate to the project directory
    cd <somewhere>/mod-5/
3: create the virtual env in a folder called virtualenv by running the following
    python3 -m venv virtualenv
        Note: this will create a new folder calles virtualenv that will be ignored by git because of the .gitignore file.
4: activate the virtual env
    source ./virtualenv/bin/activate
        You should now see (virtualenv) in your console
5: upgrade pip3
    pip3 install --upgrade pip
6: download project requirements from the requirements file
    pip3 install -r pip3requirments.txt


Installing new project requirements can be done with
    pip3 install -r pip3requirements.txt


To DISABLE the virtual environment:
1. just type
    deactivate



To ADD a project requirement:
1. install needed package
    pip3 install <package>
2. check requirements file
    pip3 freeze
3. to overwrite the project requirements file 
    pip3 freeze > pip3requirements.txt
