1. I think Raspbian comes with git installed. Otherwise, run the following:
    sudo apt install git
2. Now navigate to the directory in which you want to create the mod-5 project directory and clone the repository. 
    git clone https://git.snt.utwente.nl/s2014203/mod-5.git (inside directory of choice)
3. Get inside the repository. It should contain the all the master branch files, as well as a .git folder containing local settings
    cd ./mod-5/ && ls -a
4. Create a new branch called <yourFirstName> and switch to it
    git checkout -b <yourFirstName>
    Notice: It's probably best if everyone gets their own branch to work from.
5. Set the new branch as upstream
git push --set-upstream origin <yourFirstName>
6. git status
7. Make changes then
git commit -m "<Descriptive commit message>" 
git push
