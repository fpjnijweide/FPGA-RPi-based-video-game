1. I think Raspbian comes with git installed. Otherwise, run the following:
    sudo apt install git

2. Now navigate to the directory in which you want to create the mod-5 project directory and clone the repository. 
    git clone https://git.snt.utwente.nl/s2014203/mod-5.git (inside directory of choice)

3. Get inside the repository. It should contain the all the master branch files, as well as a .git folder containing local settings
    cd ./mod-5/ && ls -a

4. Create a new branch called <yourFirstName> and switch to it
    git checkout -b <yourFirstName>
    Notice: It's probably best if everyone gets their own branch to work from.

5. Set the new branch as upstream
    git push --set-upstream origin <yourFirstName>

6. Pull from the repo (to get changes made by others)
    git fetch origin master
    git fetch

7. Make sure you are working on your own branch
    git checkout <yourFirstName>


8. Make changes then
    git pull
    git status
    git diff /*to see the changes you made to files*/
    git add <file_you_changed>
    git commit -m "<Descriptive commit message>" 
    git push

9. merge from the git.snt.utwente.nl page (this way you dont have to switch branches)

10. To make git remember your gitlab username and password (for 15 minutes after you entered it)
    git config --global credential.helper cache

11. To change password cache time
    git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=<timeout_in_seconds>'
